This repository contains the code and resources for building a recommendation system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the Spotify Tracks Dataset. The goal of this project is to create a music recommendation system that suggests tracks similar to a given input track, based on the features of the tracks such as 'danceability', 'energy','loudness', 'speechiness', 'acousticness', 'instrumentalness', 'liveness', 'tempo','track_genre' (which is encoded since it is a categorical variable).

## Introduction

In this project, we have developed a recommendation system using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to provide music suggestions to users based on the audio features of tracks. KNN is a simple but effective algorithm that finds the 'k' nearest neighbors to a given input and recommends items that those neighbors have liked or interacted with. This approach has been applied to the Spotify Tracks Dataset to create a music recommendation system.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Spotify Tracks Dataset]((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset)), which contains a collection of tracks from Spotify along with their audio features such as danceability, energy, tempo, etc. This dataset serves as the basis for training the KNN model to make recommendations.
